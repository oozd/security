Exact same topology used which is stated on the homework pdf,
but I provide a topology file in the zip anyways. You can use
that provided topology file too.

############ Important Points #############
*   I used python.

*** I used a library called "Scapy". This library should be installed
in order to run the code. This library is used to spoof the source ip
and/or source port easily.

*** The T-bag's raw socket is used at 4.line of the code.
s = conf.L3socket(iface='T-bag-eth0')
The part which says 'T-bag-eth0' should be given correctly. This can be found
by typing ifconfig on T-bag's terminal. And getting the first interface name.
It is the first word of the very first line of the output of ifconfig on T-bag's terminal.



Then the code can be run as: python flood.py

I used this site to improve my scapy performance. I gave created scapy packet to the raw
python socket.

// Related code part from the website.

from scapy.all import *

s = conf.L3socket(iface='enp3s0') // that line is used to create socket.
for i in range(0, 10):
    s.send(ARP(pdst='192.168.1.88',  // sending the packet with the created socket.
               psrc='192.168.1.11', 
               hwdst='f0:84:2f:fb:a8:89', 
               op='is-at')
          )
    print 'sent packet'
